    "Traditional web hosting typically involves renting server space or infrastructure from a hosting provider to host a website or web application. The server hardware is physically located in a data center managed by the hosting provider. In contrast, cloud hosting uses virtualized infrastructure provided by cloud service providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Cloud hosting offers scalability, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness compared to traditional hosting. With cloud hosting, resources can be easily scaled up or down based on demand, and users pay only for the resources they consume"
